Above I palced my project that simulates a door locking system. The user can open the "door", represented by a servomotor, by introducing a 4 digits/symbols password on the 4x4 keypad. If the password is correct the green led will light up and the servomotor's paddle turns to 90degrees, which means "open". Else, the red led is on and the buzzer will make a short sound which means that the password is wrong. Along all those operations the blue led is lit up meaning that the system is functional. 
All these operations can be seen in the video above.
